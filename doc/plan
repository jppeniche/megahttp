This is going to be a HTTP server that streams files from mega.co.nz
cloud storage.

A client would request the file with a URL like this:
http://localhost:8080/?url=<MEGA_URL>
where MEGA_URL is a URL to a shared file in MEGA, or
http://localhost:8080/?file=/Root/FILE_PATH
which would get FILE_PATH from the configured MEGA account.

Caching of downloaded files from MEGA is planned: either in-memory
caching or saving the files to disk (with configurable cache size limits).

Configuration would be achieved with a megahttp.conf file in the
source directory or in the user's home directory. It would contain
options like MEGA authentication information and caching options.

Library requirements:
|- MEGA SDK  - for interacting with MEGA - github.com/meganz/sdk
|- libasyncd - HTTP server library (can be changed to another one in the future)
|  - github.com/wolkykim/libasyncd
|- threads, if a single-theaded model doesn't work
|  \- pthread or C++ threads
\- CMake     - build system

What C++ features will be used:
|- memory management with new/delete
|- classes / STL containers / iostream for the cache
|- iterators
|- strings
|- lambdas
\- exception handling
