Garbage collection in cache
---------------------------
Garbage collector is run in `cache_item`'s constructor if
(cache_max_memory - cache_used_memory < new_file.size) [1]

It sorts the `cache_item`s in least-recently-used-first order
and removes them (if they are not being served at the moment)
until [1] becomes false or it reaches the end of the list.

file_cache_item{}
 \-> file_cache.garbage_collect()
